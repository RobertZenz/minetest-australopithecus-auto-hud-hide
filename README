    autohudhide_activate = true
    
    # If the healthbar should be automatically hidden, defaults to true.

    # to 5 seconds.

    # If the hotbar should be automatically hidden, defaults to true.
    autohudhide_hotbar_autohide = true
    
    # The delay after which the hotbar is hidden, in seconds, defaults
    # to 3 seconds.
    autohudhide_hotbar_delay = 3
    
    # The interval in which the check is run, in seconds, defaults to 0.1.
    autohudhide_interval = 0.1
